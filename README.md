A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides AI assistants with access to OSDU platform capabilities.

## Purpose

This server enables AI assistants to interact with OSDU platform services including search, data management, and schema operations through the MCP protocol.

## AI-Driven Development

This project follows an AI-driven development workflow:
- ðŸ¤– **Built with AI** - Developed using Claude Code and GitHub Copilot
- ðŸ“‹ **AI Task Assignment** - Issues labeled with `copilot` are automatically assigned
- ðŸ“š **AI-Friendly Documentation** - Comprehensive guides for AI agents in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) and [.github/copilot-instructions.md](.github/copilot-instructions.md)
- ðŸ”„ **Multi-Agent Orchestration** - Different AI agents handle different tasks based on their strengths

See our [Case Study](case-study.md) for insights on building quality code with AI agents.

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd osdu-mcp-server

# Install using uv (recommended)
uv sync
uv pip install -e '.[dev]'
```

## Configuration

To utilize this MCP server directly in other projects either use the buttons to install in VSCode, edit the `.mcp.json` file directory.

> Clients tend to have slightly different configurations

To use the OSDU MCP Server, configure it through your MCP client's configuration file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "osdu-mcp-server": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "osdu-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "OSDU_MCP_SERVER_URL": "https://your-osdu.com",
        "OSDU_MCP_SERVER_DATA_PARTITION": "your-partition",
        "AZURE_CLIENT_ID": "your-client-id",
        "AZURE_TENANT_ID": "your-tenant"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Authentication Methods

Authentication is handled via the Azure CLI by default. You must be logged in using `az login` before running the server:

To enable Service Principal authentication, add the optional `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variable:.


### Write Operations

Write operations (create, update) for any service are disabled by default, you must explicitly enable them:

```json
"env": {
  "OSDU_MCP_ENABLE_WRITE_MODE": "true"
}
```

### Delete Operations

Delete and purge operations are separately controlled and disabled by default:

```json
"env": {
  "OSDU_MCP_ENABLE_DELETE_MODE": "true"
}
```

This dual protection allows you to enable data creation and updates while maintaining strict control over destructive operations.

### Logging Configuration

The MCP server uses structured JSON logging that follows [ADR-016](docs/adr/016-structured-logging-and-observability-pattern.md). By default, logging is disabled due to verbosity. You can enable it by setting:

```json
"env": {
  "OSDU_MCP_LOGGING_ENABLED": "true",
  "OSDU_MCP_LOGGING_LEVEL": "INFO" 
}
```

Valid logging levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
